This package provides functions to perform maximum likelihood estimation in the field of discrete latent variable models. Three different variants of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm are implemented (standard, tempered, and evolutionary), and many models are taken into account (Latent Class, Hidden Markov, and Stochastic Block models).
